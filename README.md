# Assumptions
The file size being returned is in bytes. There is some converstions happening so this is important. 

# Notes
yarn version: `1.22.0`

# Further improvements:
Split the componentDidMount() into seperate functions or use hooks.
Use prop types and typescript.
Extend testing and handling of different error states.
    For example: 
    - when a folder has no children, display an inline error message.
    - when a folder has no contents dont show arror

Cheers!
